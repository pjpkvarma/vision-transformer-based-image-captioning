# ViT-based Image Captioning

This project implements an image captioning pipeline using a Vision Transformer (ViT) as the encoder and a transformer-based language decoder. It is trained on the Flickr8k dataset to generate descriptive captions for natural images.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features
- Vision Transformer (ViT) for visual feature extraction
- Hugging Face EncoderDecoderModel
- Custom PyTorch Dataset for Flickr8k
- Image preprocessing and caption tokenization
- Evaluation with BLEU score
